Soo it's like 1:21AM and I've been working on setting up this thing all day but **IT WORKS**

Hope it stays unbroken for the rest of the time I plan to use it, but let's be honest probably later when I wake up it will be on fire.

Buuuuuut that's all for today (or tonight?) so good night and please don't break <3

PD: have to figure out how to add emojis on here 🐛
